# Edge_exchangeable_random_graph_models
This dissertation paper provides an introductory overview and a brief analysis of the classical one-parameter Chinese Restaurant Process and its extended two-parameter model, which contributes significantly to the understandings of modern interaction data, such as email exchanges and phone calls. To investigate these interactions via edge-labeled networks, I present the well-known Hollywood model using the two-parameter CRP, which generates edge-exchangeable hypergraphs with satisfying statistical features. As the binary edge-exchangeable graphs are more prevalent and are of great research interest, I introduce the binary Hollywood model and perform its Frequentist inference in terms of maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of parameters as well as its Bayesian posterior inference via a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Provided the strong implications of edge-exchangeability examined in the previous literature, I finally propose and investigate a more structured random graph model based on the binary Hollywood process, which relaxes the exchangeability assumption and evolves over time through an additional parameter. The R code for this paper can be found in the appendix.
